{"name":"Malhar","tagline":"DataTorrent open source library.","body":"Malhar\r\n======\r\nMalhar repository contains open source operator and codec library that can be used with the DataTorrent platform to build Realtime streaming applications. In addition to the library there are benchmark, contrib, demos, webdemos and samples folders available. Demos contain demo applications built using the library operators. Webdemos contain webpages for the demos. Benchmark contains performance testing applications. Contrib contains additional operators that interface with third party softwares. Samples contain some sample code that shows how to use the library operators.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DataTorrent/Malhar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DataTorrent/Malhar)\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis project welcomes new contributors.

Documentation\r\nfor the platform itself can be found at [Resources](https://datatorrent.com/resources.php).\r\n\r\nDiscussion group\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nPlease use the [Malhar discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/malhar-users) for support. Subscription to the group is open and postings are welcome. You can post anything about the operators, discuss new operator ideas or report issues and get answers from experts. You can signup by going to the following url https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/malhar-users\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting the source code\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Malhar repository is on github.com. You can download or clone it using the GitHub links.  If you already have a GitHub account you can fork the DataTorrent/Malhar repository and contribute with pull requests.  See Contributing section below.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompiling the code\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe project uses maven to build the code. To build the code run mvn install at the top level. The code also has a dependency to the DataTorrent API. The API releases are available in the DataTorrent maven repository and the Malhar pom.xml is configured with it. Individual modules such as library can be built independently by changing directory to the module and running maven there.\r\n\r\nRunning the code\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nTo run the code DataTorrent platform is needed. The developer version or an evaluation version, both of which are free, can be downloaded from \r\n\r\nhttps://www.datatorrent.com/download.php\r\n\r\nPlease follow the instructions in the software README on how to run the application.  \r\n\r\nFor an easer setup, sandbox virtual machine provides pre-configured DataTorrent platform with all necessary dependencies, and can be found in the download section.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemos\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nMultiple demos are provided with the DataTorrent platform to showcase the platform and provide application development examples.  Demos can be executed after downloading and installing DataTorrent platform or the sandbox with pre-configured DataTorrent platform environment.  See [demos source code](https://github.com/DataTorrent/Malhar/tree/master/demos/src/main/java/com/datatorrent/demos) for application development examples.\r\n\r\nWeb Apps\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWeb interface for the following demos is available:\r\n- Twitter\r\n- Mobile\r\n- Machine Generated Data\r\n- Ads Dimensions\r\n- Fraud\r\n\r\nWeb apps run on Node.js. Please see [webapps](https://github.com/DataTorrent/Malhar/tree/master/webapps) for more information.\r\n\r\nIssue tracking\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[Malhar JIRA](https://malhar.atlassian.net) issue tracking system is used for this project. You can monitor the state of existing issues and their track their progress at https://malhar.atlassian.net\r\n\r\nWhen working with JIRA to submit pull requests, please use [smart commits](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Processing+JIRA+issues+with+commit+messages) feature by specifying MLHR-XXXX in the commit messages.  It helps us link commits with issues being tracked for easy reference.  And example commit might look like this:\r\n\r\n    git commit -am \"MLHR-12345 #comment Task completed ahead of schedule #resolve\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

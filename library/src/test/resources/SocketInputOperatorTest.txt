Lastly, the company says its algorithms can optimize the mix between app install ads and brand ads.
Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software.
Below you will find valuable resources including case studies and white papers that will help you implement cost-effective database solutions using MySQL.
